# Account Takeover

Account takeover (ATO) is a form of identity theft where a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to a user's online account, often by exploiting weak or stolen login credentials. Once the attacker has control over the account, they can carry out a variety of malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive data, making unauthorized purchases, or sending spam and phishing emails.

Here are two example proof of concepts (PoCs) that illustrate account takeover attacks:

**PoC 1: Credential stuffing attack** 

In this example, an attacker has obtained a large list of email and password combinations from a data breach. They decide to target an e-commerce website to see if any of the credentials work.

- The attacker uses an automated tool to systematically test the leaked email and password combinations on the e-commerce website's login page.
- They discover that several of the leaked credentials work on the website, indicating that the users reused their passwords across multiple services.
- The attacker gains access to the compromised accounts and starts making unauthorized purchases using the stored payment information.
- In some cases, they may also change the account's email and password, effectively locking out the legitimate user.

Defenses against credential stuffing:

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts.
- Encourage users to create strong, unique passwords for each online service.
- Monitor login attempts and employ rate limiting to prevent automated attacks.
- Use CAPTCHAs to deter bots.


**PoC 2: Phishing attack**

In this example, the attacker creates a fake email that appears to be from a popular social media platform, urging users to update their account information.

- The attacker crafts a phishing email that looks like a legitimate message from the social media platform, asking users to update their account details due to a security issue.
- The email contains a link to a fake login page, which is designed to look like the real platform's login page.
- Unsuspecting users click on the link, enter their email and password, and unknowingly give their credentials to the attacker.
- The attacker then uses these stolen credentials to log in to the users' accounts, potentially stealing personal information, sending malicious messages, or spreading the phishing campaign further.

Defenses against phishing attacks:

- Educate users about phishing and how to spot suspicious emails and links.
- Implement email security measures, such as DMARC, DKIM, and SPF, to reduce the chances of phishing emails reaching users.
- Encourage the use of password managers, which can help users identify fake login pages.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user accounts.
