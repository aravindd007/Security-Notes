# Docker Exploits

Docker employs the same technology used in containerisation to isolate applications into containers called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is essentially an API that runs on the host operating system, which communicates between the operating system and containers to access the systemâ€™s hardware (such as CPU, RAM, networking and disk)

Because of this, the Docker engine is extensive and allows you to do things like:

- Connect containers together (for example, a container running a web application and another container running a database)
- Export and import applications (images)
- Transfer files between the operating system and container
