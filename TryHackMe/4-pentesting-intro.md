# Introduction to Pentesting 

A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.
According to Security Magazine, a cybersecurity industry magazine, there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day - 1 attack every 39 seconds.


## Penetration Testing Ethics 

Penetration test is an **authorised audit** and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems. 
Anything that falls outside of this agreement is deemed unauthorised

Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs.
This discussion forms the **scope of the penetration testing agreement**

|   White Hat  |           These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.          |      For example, a penetration tester performing an authorised engagement on a company.     |
|   Grey Hat   | These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times. |                       For example, someone taking down a scamming site.                      |
|   Black Hat  |   These people  are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.    | For example, ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom. |


**Rules of Engagement (ROE)**

The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections (explained in the table below), which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. The SANS institute has a great example of this document which you can view online here.

|   Section  |                                                                                                                      Description                                                                                                                     |
|:----------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Permission |                     This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.                    |
| Test Scope |                   This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.                  |
|    Rules   | The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay. |

|         Stage         |                                                                                                                                                                                    Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:---------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Information Gathering |                                                                                       This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.  Note: This does not involve scanning any systems.                                                                                      |
|  Enumeration/Scanning |                                                                                                              This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.                                                                                                             |
|      Exploitation     |                                                                                                     This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.                                                                                                     |
|  Privilege Escalation | Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator). |
|   Post-exploitation   |                                                                             This stage involves a few sub-stages:  1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting) 2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user 3.  Covering your tracks 4. Reporting                                                                             |
