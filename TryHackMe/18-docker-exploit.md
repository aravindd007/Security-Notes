# Docker Exploits

Docker employs the same technology used in containerisation to isolate applications into containers called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is essentially an API that runs on the host operating system, which communicates between the operating system and containers to access the system’s hardware (such as CPU, RAM, networking and disk)

Because of this, the Docker engine is extensive and allows you to do things like:

- Connect containers together (for example, a container running a web application and another container running a database)
- Export and import applications (images)
- Transfer files between the operating system and container

## History of Docker
Originally created by Solomon Hykes in 2013, Docker is open-source and has become a well-renowned name within containerisation.

Docker started as an internal project for dotCloud (a PaaS provider), where it was then showcased in PyCon in 2013 and then quickly made open-source.

While containerisation's original concepts started in 1979 with Unix V7, Docker has made containerisation a popular technology since its release in 2013. Docker’s popularity is due to making the benefits of containerisation accessible and modern.

As of April 2022, It is fair to say that Docker is extremely popular. To be precise:
- 13 million developers are using Docker [1]
- There are 7 million applications made and ready to use with Docker [2]
- 13 billion applications are downloaded monthly! [3]
- …and this is just from the official repository

## How Does containerisation works?

Namespaces essentially segregate system resources such as processes, files and memory away from other namespaces.

Every process running on Linux will be assigned two things:

- A namespace
- A process identifier (PID)
Namespaces are how containerisation is achieved! Processes can only "see" other processes that are in the same namespace - no conflicts in theory. Take Docker, for example, every new container will be running as a new namespace, although the container may be running multiple applications (and in turn, processes).
