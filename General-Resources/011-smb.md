# SMB: Server Message Block 

SMB (Server Message Block) is a network protocol used for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network. It's primarily used on systems that run Windows, but can also be found on other systems.

As a red teamer, enumerating SMB shares can provide a wealth of information about the target system, including the potential to access sensitive data, enumerate users and groups, or even exploit vulnerable software versions.

Here are some best practices and strategies:

**1. Identifying SMB Shares**

One of the first steps you can take is to identify any SMB shares on the network. Tools like Nmap can be used to scan the network for devices running SMB:

```bash
nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 10.0.0.0/24
```

**2. Connecting to SMB Shares**

Once you've identified a target, you can use the `smbclient` tool to connect to an SMB share and browse its contents:

```bash
smbclient \\\\10.0.0.2\\SharedFolder
```

Remember, you'll need to replace `10.0.0.2` and `SharedFolder` with the actual IP address and share name.

**3. Enumerating SMB Shares**

After connecting to the SMB share, you can list the contents of the share using the `ls` command in the `smbclient` shell. You can also download files using the `get` command.

**4. Null Sessions**

A null session is when you establish an SMB connection to a system without a username or password. Some older or misconfigured systems may allow this, and it can provide a significant amount of information. Here's an example of connecting with a null session:

```bash
smbclient -N -L \\10.0.0.2
```

**5. Enumerating Users and Groups**

You can enumerate users and groups using the `enum4linux` tool:

```bash
enum4linux -U 10.0.0.2
```

**6. Vulnerability Scanning**

You can also use tools like Nmap or Nessus to scan for known vulnerabilities in SMB services.

**Important Considerations**

As a Red Teamer, always be aware of the following:

- **Scope**: Stay within the defined scope of your engagement. Don't target systems or networks that are out of scope.

- **Noise**: Remember, activities like scanning and enumerating can be noisy and may trigger IDS/IPS alarms. Be aware of this and use tactics to evade detection when necessary, such as slow scanning or using decoys.

- **Data Handling**: Handle any data you obtain carefully. It may contain sensitive information. Make sure it is stored securely and disposed of properly once it is no longer needed.


### Cheat Sheet for SMB

Absolutely, here's a concise Red Team cheat sheet for SMB (Server Message Block) enumeration:

**1. Identify SMB Shares**

Use Nmap to identify hosts running SMB service:

```bash
nmap -p 445 --open -v 10.0.0.0/24
```

**2. SMB Version Scanning**

Scan for SMB version:

```bash
nmap --script smb-protocols -p445 10.0.0.2
```

**3. Enumerate SMB Shares**

Enumerate SMB shares with Nmap:

```bash
nmap -p 445 --script=smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse 10.0.0.2
```

**4. Connect to SMB Share**

Connect to SMB share using smbclient:

```bash
smbclient \\\\10.0.0.2\\SharedFolder
```

**5. Null Session Enumeration**

Create a null session and list SMB shares:

```bash
smbclient -N -L \\10.0.0.2
```

**6. Enumerate Users and Groups**

Use enum4linux to enumerate users and groups:

```bash
enum4linux -U 10.0.0.2
```

**7. SMB Vulnerability Scanning**

Scan for known vulnerabilities:

```bash
nmap --script smb-vuln-* -p 445 10.0.0.2
```

**Note:** Please replace `10.0.0.0/24` and `10.0.0.2` with your actual network range and IP address, and `SharedFolder` with the actual share name.
