# Introduction to Pentesting 

A Penetration test or pentest is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information. A penetration test involves using the same tools, techniques, and methodologies that someone with malicious intent would use and is similar to an audit.
According to Security Magazine, a cybersecurity industry magazine, there are over 2,200 cyber attacks every day - 1 attack every 39 seconds.

## PENTESTING FUNDAMENTALS
### Penetration Testing Ethics 

Penetration test is an **authorised audit** and defences as agreed by the owners of the systems. 
Anything that falls outside of this agreement is deemed unauthorised

Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs.
This discussion forms the **scope of the penetration testing agreement**

|   White Hat  |           These hackers are considered the "good people". They remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others.          |      For example, a penetration tester performing an authorised engagement on a company.     |
|   Grey Hat   | These people use their skills to benefit others often; however, they do not respect/follow the law or ethical standards at all times. |                       For example, someone taking down a scamming site.                      |
|   Black Hat  |   These people  are criminals and often seek to damage organisations or gain some form of financial benefit at the cost of others.    | For example, ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom. |


**Rules of Engagement (ROE)**

The ROE is a document that is created at the initial stages of a penetration testing engagement. This document consists of three main sections (explained in the table below), which are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out. The SANS institute has a great example of this document which you can view online here. 
https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/bF4I3yCcnt/?

|   Section  |                                                                                                                      Description                                                                                                                     |
|:----------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Permission |                     This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.                    |
| Test Scope |                   This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.                  |
|    Rules   | The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay. |

### Penetration Testing Methodologies 


|         Stage         |                                                                                                                                                                                    Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:---------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Information Gathering |                                                                                       This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.  Note: This does not involve scanning any systems.                                                                                      |
|  Enumeration/Scanning |                                                                                                              This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.                                                                                                             |
|      Exploitation     |                                                                                                     This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.                                                                                                     |
|  Privilege Escalation | Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator). |
|   Post-exploitation   |                                                                             This stage involves a few sub-stages:  1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting) 2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user 3.  Covering your tracks 4. Reporting                                                                             |


**OSSTMM**

The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.
> https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf 

The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:
- Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)
- Wired Networks
- Wireless communications

**OWASP**  
The "Open Web Application Security Project" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services 

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1**  
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honourable mention because of its popularity and detail.
 
**NCSC CAF**  
The Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.

The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:
- Data security
- System security
- Identity and access control
- Resiliency
- Monitoring
- Response and recovery planning

### Black/Grey/White Box Testing 

![boxes](./media/4-boxes.png)

There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service. Your understanding of your target will determine the level of testing that you perform in your penetration testing engagement. In this task, we'll cover these three different scopes of testing.

**Black-Box Testing**  
This testing process is a high-level process where the tester is not given any information about the inner workings of the application or service.

**Grey-Box Testing**  
the limited knowledge given saves time, and is often chosen for extremely well-hardened attack surfaces.

**White-Box Testing**
The tester will have full knowledge of the application and its expected behaviour






## My Key Take Aways 

Make sure to discuss first with the System owner about the attack and create a **RULES OF ENGAGEMENT**. 

Stages of the Pentetration testing are:
- Info Gathering 
- Enumeration/Scanning
- Exploitation
- Privilege Escalation
- Post-Exploitation 

And After the attack there are alot of Pen Test Assessment Framework you can use. 
mainly I think I'll focus on **OWASP**


There a lot of Pentesting Assessment Frameworks
