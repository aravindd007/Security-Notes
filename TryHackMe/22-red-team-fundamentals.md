# Red Team Fundamentals

Cybersecurity is a constant race between white hat hackers and black hat hackers. As threats in the cyber-world evolve, so does the need for more specialized services that allow companies to prepare for real attacks the best they can.

While conventional security engagements like vulnerability assessments and penetration tests could provide an excellent overview of the technical security posture of a company, they might overlook some other aspects that a real attacker can exploit. In that sense, we could say that conventional penetration tests are good at showing vulnerabilities so that you can take proactive measures but might not teach you how to respond to an actual ongoing attack by a motivated adversary.


**Vulnerability Assessments**

Vulnerability Assessments aim to find weaknesses in network systems. They scan many hosts for security flaws but avoid harmful actions. Focus is on identifying issues and enabling effective fixes. Automated tools and non-technical operators are mostly used. It's like spotting problems without causing harm.

**Pentetration Tests**
Penetration Tests go beyond finding vulnerabilities. They try to exploit them and assess their impact on the whole network. It's like testing how attackers could use weaknesses to break in and spread through the network. This approach considers vulnerabilities' interactions. It's about understanding how attackers can exploit weaknesses for wider damage.


**Advanced Persistent Threats and why Regular Pentesting is not Enough**
Regular pentesting has limitations: it's loud, may miss non-tech attacks, and relaxes security. Real attackers (Advanced Persistent Threats or APTs) are more covert and skilled. They persistently infiltrate networks. APTs challenge companies' readiness, often targeting critical sectors. Red teaming is a realistic response to APTs, simulating actual attacks for better defense.
