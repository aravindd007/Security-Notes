### NSE Scripts
There are many categories available. Some useful categories include:

- safe:- Won't affect the target
- intrusive:- Not safe: likely to affect the target
- vuln:- Scan for vulnerabilities
- exploit:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
- auth:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
- brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
- discovery:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).

### Notes:
- If a port is closed, server should respond with `RST` flag
- If a UDP port doesn't respond to an Nmap scan it will respond as `open|filtered`

- SYN scans are often not logged by applications listening on open ports, as standard practice is to log a connection once it's been fully established. Again, this plays into the idea of SYN scans being stealthy.
